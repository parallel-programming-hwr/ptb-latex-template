The PTB LaTeX template is a template to use for writing PTBs. Each chapter should be defined in a seperate `.tex`-file in the *chapters* folder. To include the chapter, use `\include{chapters/chaptername}` in the `document.tex` file. The metadata of the document should be defined in the `metadata.sty`. The `document.tex` can be renamed without problems to the name the output pdf should have.
